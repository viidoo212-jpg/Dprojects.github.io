Average wait time: 5.65 minutes/hours (depending on metric), indicating overall moderate efficiency.

Bed occupancy rate: 75.33%, suggesting most facilities have stable utilization without being overwhelmed.

51 hospitals tracked within the MEDITRACK system.

40 patients per doctor, indicating average clinical workload.

Operational Trends,

Monthly comparison of 2023 vs 2024 admissions shows fluctuations, with noticeable dips and peaks that can guide staffing and planning.

Geographical admission distribution reveals key regions driving patient activity.

Department-level analysis shows consistent demand across major specialties like General Surgery, Cardiology, and Pediatrics.

Hospital-level rankings highlight top-performing facilities in patient admissions.</p>
